## Dr. Silvia-Jessica Mostacedo-Marasovic

**Discipline-Based Education Research | Water & Sustainability | Sustainability Education | Decision-Making**

I study how people learn to make better decisions about shared resources, especially water. My work focuses on how students and educators understand complex systems (like watersheds and climate) and how they weigh tradeoffs when decisions affect many people.

I design and study learning tools that help learners:
- see the “big picture” of water systems,
- understand different stakeholder perspectives,
- use data and models to support decisions.
