## Teaching philosophy (brief)
My teaching is grounded in discipline-based education research (DBER) and inclusive, evidence-based pedagogy. I design learning experiences that prioritize sense-making, systems thinking, and decision-making with data and models, with particular attention to supporting culturally and linguistically diverse learners.

## Course and curriculum development
- Developed and coordinated an asynchronous undergraduate course: **ENVR 2316: Conservation of Natural Resources** (planned implementation Fall 2026)
- Designed asynchronous modules on **hydrologic, climate, Earth, and planetary systems** using the **5E instructional model** and translanguaging approaches
- Developed undergraduate modules on **decision-making and water economics** for an online asynchronous *Water in Society* course

## Professional development
- Delivered hybrid workshops on **R programming**, **learning analytics**, and **social network analysis**
- Co-led faculty development workshops to support adoption of **Food–Energy–Water (FEW) Nexus** curricular resources

## Teaching strengths
- Asynchronous and hybrid instruction
- Learning with models, data visualizations, and decision tools
- Curriculum design for multilingual and emergent bilingual learners
- Transparent assessment and feedback practices
